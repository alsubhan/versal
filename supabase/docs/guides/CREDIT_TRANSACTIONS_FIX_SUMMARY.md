# Credit Transactions Table Fix - Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

The `credit_transactions` table had an incorrect design where it referenced `sales_order_id` instead of `sale_invoice_id`. This was problematic because:

❌ **Wrong Level**: Store credit is consumed at the **invoice payment level**, not sales order level  
❌ **Incorrect Flow**: Credit usage should happen when customer actually pays, not when order is placed  
❌ **Missing Multi-Tender Support**: Can't properly track mixed payment methods (cash + store credit)  

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250131_fix_credit_transactions_sale_invoice_reference.sql`

- ✅ **Replaced** `sales_order_id` with `sale_invoice_id`
- ✅ **Added** proper foreign key constraint to `sale_invoices` table
- ✅ **Created** index for performance on `sale_invoice_id`
- ✅ **Added** constraint to ensure valid credit transaction references
- ✅ **Extended** transaction type enum with new credit types

### 2. New Transaction Types

```sql
-- Store Credit (Credit Notes)
'credit_issued'     -- When credit note creates store credit
'credit_used'       -- When store credit is used for invoice payment
'credit_expired'    -- When store credit expires
'credit_adjusted'   -- Manual adjustments

-- Invoice Credit (Sale Invoices)  
'invoice_credit_used'     -- When invoice credit is used
'invoice_credit_adjusted' -- Manual invoice credit adjustments
```

### 3. Automatic Store Credit Usage

**Function**: `handle_store_credit_usage()`
**Trigger**: `on_customer_payment_store_credit_usage`

- ✅ **Automatically** creates credit transaction when customer pays with store credit
- ✅ **Updates** customer credit balance (`available_credit`, `used_credit`)
- ✅ **Prevents** over-usage by checking available credit
- ✅ **Links** to specific invoice for audit trail

### 4. Frontend Type Updates

**File**: `frontend/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

- ✅ **Updated** `credit_transactions` table types
- ✅ **Added** `sale_invoice_id` field
- ✅ **Extended** `transaction_type` enum
- ✅ **Updated** `invoice_status` to include `"partial"`
- ✅ **Updated** `so_status` to include `"partial"` and `"fulfilled"`

## Correct Credit Flow

### Store Credit Issuance
```
Credit Note (approved) 
    ↓
credit_transactions (credit_issued) → credit_note_id populated
    ↓
customer_credit_balances.available_credit increases
```

### Store Credit Usage
```
Sale Invoice Payment
    ↓
Customer Payment with Store Credit
    ↓
credit_transactions (credit_used) → sale_invoice_id populated
    ↓
customer_credit_balances.available_credit decreases
```

### Multi-Tender Payment Example
```
Invoice Total: ₹1000
├── Cash Payment: ₹400
├── Store Credit: ₹600
    ↓
credit_transactions (credit_used) → amount: ₹600, sale_invoice_id: [invoice_id]
customer_payments → amount: ₹400, payment_method: 'cash'
```

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Accurate Payment Tracking**: Credit consumed at actual payment time  
✅ **Multi-Tender Support**: Mix of payment methods per invoice  
✅ **Better Audit Trail**: Link credit usage to specific invoices  
✅ **Financial Accuracy**: Credit balance updates at payment processing  
✅ **Compliance**: Proper separation of store credit vs invoice credit  
✅ **Performance**: Indexed foreign key for faster queries  

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** in your Supabase database
2. **Test** store credit usage in invoice payments
3. **Verify** credit balance updates work correctly
4. **Check** that multi-tender payments function properly

## Files Modified

- `supabase/migrations/20250131_fix_credit_transactions_sale_invoice_reference.sql` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` (UPDATED)

The fix ensures that store credit is properly consumed at the invoice payment level, providing accurate credit tracking and supporting multi-tender payment scenarios.
